# Install-OtherOSes-on-System76
This goes over steps that I have done to install other OSes on System76 hardware.

## Arch install steps   : DONE

Everything seems to work other then graphic switching for NVIDIA systems. 

## Debian install steps : DONE

Everything seems to work other then graphic switching for NVIDIA systems. NVIDIA systems will be in NVIDIA mode at all times. Right now we can't install system76-power and other packages due to libc6 being too old.
