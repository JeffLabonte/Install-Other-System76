## Arch install steps   : [x]

Everything seems to work other then graphic switching for NVIDIA systems. 

## Debian install steps : DONE

Everything seems to work other then graphic switching for NVIDIA systems. NVIDIA systems will be in NVIDIA mode at all times. Right now we can't install system76-power and other packages due to libc6 being too old.
